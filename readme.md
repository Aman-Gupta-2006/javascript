## In the project1 and project2 i have revisited the basic usage of the event listeners and the basic events on them 

### project 1 is about changing the background color of the page, when click event is invoked by clicking on any of the buttons

### project 2 is about calculating the BMI, handled the default propogation of form and reading the value from form and displaying the BMI after calculations
